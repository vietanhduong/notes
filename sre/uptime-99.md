## Avaiability

### Time-Based Availability

* Target of 99.5% means 1,83 days a year downtime is tolerated;
* Target of 99.9% availability means 8,76 hours a year of downtime is tolerated;
* Target of 99.95% availability means 4,38 hours a year of downtime is tolerated;
* Target of 99.99% availability means 52,6 minutes a year of downtime is tolerated;

## Service Levels

* SLIs (Service Level Idicators), like avaiability, system throughput, error rate, request latency;
* SLOs (Service Level Objectives), which define a target value (or range of va;ues) for SLIs, for
examples, setting the availability target to 99.9% for a given service or setting a specific request
latency target to be less than 100ms;
* SLAs (Service Level Agreements), contracts with users stating consequences of meeting or specific SLOs.
Their definition depends on the level of formalization required with users and the confidence to
achieve SLOs.
